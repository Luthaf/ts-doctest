# Doc Tests for TypeScript Projects

`typescript-doctest` provides a CLI to generate doc tests from your TypeScript documentation.

## Installation

`npm install -g typescript-doctest`

## Features

- Generates tests for all codeblocks in your docs that start with `typescript doctest` 
- Also generates tests for these kind of codeblocks in your `README.md`
- Supports `import` statements and `import(...)` call resolution from within the doc tests by using the TypeScript Compiler; respecting any custom `baseUrl` or `paths` setup
- Allows to hide certain lines from your doc tests in the documentation generated by [typedoc](https://typedoc.org) by prefixing them with `#` 

> Note: You need to install `typescript-doctest` as a `dev-dependency` in your project for the typeoc integration to work.

## Example

See the included [example project](example#readme) for a basic setup.

## Usage

1. Set the language of your documentation codeblocks to `typescript doctest`
2. Run `ts-doctest PROJECT_DIR TEST_DIR`
3. Invoke your test runner
