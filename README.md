# Doc Tests for TypeScript Projects

`ts-doctest` provides a CLI to generate doc tests from your TypeScript documentation.

## Features

- Generates tests for all codeblocks in your docs that start with `typescript doctest` 
- Also generates tests for these kind of codeblocks in your `README.md`
- Support any kind of `import` statements and `import(...)` by using the TypeScript Compiler and respecting your `baseUrl` or `paths` configuration
- Allows to hide certain lines of code from the documentation generated by [typedoc](https://typedoc.org) by prefixing them with `#` but still have them run in your doc test\*

> \* You need to install `ts-doctest` as a `dev-dependency` in your project

## Usage

1. Set the language of your codeblocks to `typescript doctest`
2. Run `ts-doctest <projectDir> <testOurDir>`
3. Invoke your test runner
