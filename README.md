# Doc Tests for TypeScript Projects

`ts-doctest` provides a CLI to generate doc tests from your TypeScript documentation to be run with your favorite Test Runner.

## Features

- Generates tests for all codeblocks in your docs that start with `typescript doctest` 
- Also generates tests for these kind of codeblocks in your `README.md`
- Support any kind of `import` statements and `import(...)` by using the TypeScript Compiler and respecting your `baseUrl` or `paths` configuration
- Allows to hide certain lines of code from documentation generated by [typedoc](https://typedoc.org) by prefixing them with `#` but still have them run in your doc test - keeping your documentation clean

## Usage

```bash
ts-doctest <projectDir> <testOurDir>
```

## Example

```typescript doctest
// This is a Doc Test 
expect(1 + 1).toEqual(2);
```
